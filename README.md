# SSF-Bank
Small banking web application with the ability to transfer/receive funds, changing users, sorting data, close accounts and logout timer.<br/>
There are 4 account here. In order to log in enter one of the next combinations:<br/>
login: <b>am</b> | pin: <b>1111</b> |<br/>
login: <b>jd</b> | pin: <b>2222</b> |<br/>
login: <b>stw</b> | pin: <b>3333</b> |<br/>
login: <b>ss</b> | pin: <b>4444</b> |<br/>
To transfer money from one account to another enter user login and amount. After a short delay (1sec) your money will be transfered and you can enter as another user and watch the result of this operation.<br/>
You can request for a loan - just enter amount into corresponding input. After a short delay (2.5 sec - because the bank needs to think about whether you are a reliable person. Everything is like in real life ðŸ˜‰) your account will be topped up with the desired amount (provided that at least one of your payments was more than 10% of this amount).<br/>![ssr-bank-app-scr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103335620/184427884-66ebe541-94df-4b20-ac1f-41afe71231f4.png)
There is a small bug in my application. When trying to sort movements, sorting doesn't work with dates. I'm sorry but I just couldn't fix itðŸ˜“.
